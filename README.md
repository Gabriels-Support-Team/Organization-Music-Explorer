### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt the labs were of good quality but it was hard to retain all the info form them in the short amount of time we had to complete them. I felt lesss prepared for javascript because I felt
it was more complicated yet we spent less time on it than we did html and css.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added Actual music that would play when the songs were clicked. I would like to add the ability to import a list of songs somehow. I would also like to add the ability to 
favorite a song. I would have spent more time making sure my code was as modular as possible. That is a very important thing when it comes to creating large programs and I feel I 
didn't give enough time to it. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I found the css to have gone well. I saved it for the end and I think my project looks good in terms of the css added. In terms of functionality i wish I had completed all the stretch features,
One thing that was blocking me for a long time was getting the modal to work. I noticed a few of my peers had really nice styling for their add playlist form and I would have liked to have done that.
People incorporated cool dynamic styling features that were self taught and I really would like to do that next time.
